# Text_Classifier_Using_CNN
The text classifier that I have developed uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to extract relevant features from textual data
A CNN is a deep learning algorithm that is typically used for image processing and analysis, but it can also be applied to text classification tasks such as sentiment analysis, spam detection, and topic categorization.

The CNN-based text classifier that I have created takes a sequence of words as input, which is then transformed into a matrix representation using embeddings. The convolutional layers in the network use a sliding window approach to extract features from the text input, which are then passed through a pooling layer to extract the most important features.

After pooling, the extracted features are flattened and fed into fully connected layers, which perform the classification task. These layers utilize the extracted features to classify the text into predefined categories such as positive or negative sentiment or topic categories.

The advantage of using a CNN for text classification is that it can capture local features in the text that are important for classification. This makes it particularly useful for tasks where the order of words in the text is important, such as sentiment analysis.

Overall, my text classifier using CNN is a powerful machine learning algorithm that can extract relevant features from text data and classify it into predefined categories. It is a great tool for a wide variety of text classification tasks and can be customized to suit specific needs.
